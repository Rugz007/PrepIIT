                header="What method of study will guarantee my success?"
                key={1}
              >
                Hard work is the key to success, attend classes regularly and
                complete your homework and assignments as soon as you get it.
                You must read the theory but never read the solution of the
                problems.

              <Panel

                key={2}
              >
                The study and reference material that is provided to you by
                PrepiiT are usually enough. Although faculty may recommend some
                additional references that will be made available to you.

                key={3}
              >
                One can not quantify the studies only by the number of hours put
                in, it needs to assessed periodically and will depend on your
                performance in the regular assessment. The thumb rule is to
                study at least the topics that are covered in the class the same
                day and not to pile up the backlog of studies wich eventually
                may get unmanageable.

                key={4}
              >
                There are no shortcuts to success! But you can always find
                smarter ways of studies like use mnemonics and non-linear memory
                maps. You will greatly benefit from the special sessions
                conducted on these methods by PrepiiT.

                key={6}
              >
                Group study definitely helps. Though, when should you choose to
                study in the group is very important. One must discuss and
                participate in group study at initial stages, but we believe one
                must concentrate on the self study as the exam approaches.

                in your ward's every dayâ€™s academic activities can help a great
                deal, if you just follow up on the homework assignment and keep
                the check that they are completed in time and also review the
                assessment report periodically, this way you can be sure if they

                No. They should not. The balance is must in academics and
                extracurricular activities. In fact, this balance has been
                proven to enhance the end results.
